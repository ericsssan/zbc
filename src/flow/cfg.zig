//! Layer 2 CFG types and Zig-AST → CFG lowering.
//!
//! v1 scope: extract a flow graph from a single Zig function over the
//! subset of statement shapes that affect our abstract state.  Most
//! Zig syntax doesn't change lifetime/identity; we collapse it into
//! `.plain_expr` and only emit dedicated statement nodes for the ops
//! the analyzer transfers over.
//!
//! What we DO model:
//!   - `var/const NAME = INIT;` (local binding)
//!   - `LHS = RHS;` (assignment)
//!   - call expressions (especially annotated-callee returns)
//!   - `arena.deinit()` (arena death)
//!   - `thread.join()` (thread join)
//!   - `return EXPR;` (function exit)
//!   - `if/else`, `while`, `for`, `switch` branching (real CFG edges)
//!   - `defer` / `errdefer` (replayed at function-exit / return sites)
//!
//! What we DON'T model (yet):
//!   - `try` / `catch` (error-path forking + error-set tracking)
//!   - generics / comptime
//!   - for-loop iteration variable origin (treated as .plain)
//!   - switch-case pattern bindings (treated as .plain)
//!
//! Errors during lowering are surfaced as `Stmt{.lowering_gap}` nodes
//! rather than aborts — keeps the analyzer running on the rest of the
//! function even when one statement uses an unsupported construct.
