# heap-use-after-free

Reading or returning a heap pointer after the corresponding `free` /
`destroy` call.  The value's storage has been returned to the
allocator; reading it is undefined behavior.

## Example

Incorrect — `buf` is read after free:

    const buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 32);
    allocator.free(buf);
    process(buf);                       // ← use after free

Fix — perform all reads before the free, or assign a fresh value
through the same name before re-use:

    const buf = try allocator.alloc(u8, 32);
    process(buf);
    allocator.free(buf);

## When this might be a false positive

- Conditional free + use on disjoint paths.  zbc tracks state per
  basic block and joins conservatively at merges; one branch
  freeing and another using can produce a join state that flags the
  use.  Reshape the code so the free and use are not joined.
- Re-allocation through a path zbc can't classify.  A fresh
  `buf = alloc(...)` clears the prior free, but if the rebind goes
  through an unrecognised builder method, the prior free state may
  persist.  Naming the constructor `init`/`create`/`new`/`open`
  helps the classifier recognise the fresh allocation.

## Borrow-tracking via inference

When the use happens through a borrow rather than the freed pointer
itself, zbc infers the ownership chain from body shape:

- A method whose body calls `allocator.free(self.field)` or
  `allocator.destroy(self)` is inferred as taking ownership of its
  receiver.  Subsequent uses of the receiver (or aliases captured
  before the call) fire as use-after-free.
- Pointer-typed struct fields (`*T`, `?*T`) are treated as borrows;
  reads do not propagate ownership.  Non-pointer fields (`[]u8`,
  `T`) read as owned-by-parent when the destructor frees them.

Example:

    const Owner = struct {
        data: []u8,
        pub fn die(self: *Owner, gpa: std.mem.Allocator) void {
            gpa.free(self.data);
        }
    };

    var owner = Owner{ .data = try gpa.alloc(u8, 16) };
    const borrowed = owner.data; // borrowed origin tied to owner
    owner.die(gpa);              // inferred as takes ownership(self)
    _ = borrowed;                // ← heap-use-after-free fires

  rather than a single heap allocation.
